    and trade secrets in and to the Materials, and any enhancements,
    improvements, derivative works, and modifications thereto (for
    avoidance of doubt, including those made by You). You waive and will
    not assert any moral rights to any enhancements, improvements,
    derivative works, and modifications of the Materials that You make.

    **\*Notice to EY Clients:** Certain EY clients (e.g., audit clients
    and their related entities) may be unable to qualify for a license
    to use the Materials in a production or commercial capacity due to

    commercial capacity please inquire at the address above.

6.  **[License to Feedback and Your other Modifications of

    Agreement in effect at the time You last access the Materials.

8.  **[Termination]{.underline}**. EYGS may terminate Your License or
    suspend Your access to the Materials immediately upon notice to You.

    OF the USER's USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE Materials, HOWEVER
    CAUSED, OR THE FAILURE OF THE Materials (OR ANY PART THEREOF) TO

    THIRD PARTY. IF, FOR ANY REASON, THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER SET FORTH
    SECTION 9, AND DAMAGES EXCLUSION SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 10,

    the defense and settlement of any such claim to User at User's
    expense and choice of counsel that is acceptable to EYGS. EYGS shall
    cooperate with User, at User's expense, in defending or settling
    such claim. If User refuses to take control of such defense or does
    not employ counsel acceptable to EYGS, EYGS may assume control of
    such defense at User's sole cost and expense. EYGS shall be entitled
    to approve any and all settlements of any such claims.

12. **[Compliance with Laws]{.underline}**. User shall comply with all

    to their nationals, nor to any other restricted destinations or
    persons, without first obtaining appropriate U.S. Government
    authorization. This Section is not intended to expand any license
    rights granted under this Agreement. In addition to, and without
    limiting the above requirements, User will not use (for itself or

14. **[Dispute Resolution]{.underline}**. Any controversy or claim
    arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Materials
    licensed to User hereunder (including any such matter involving any
    parent, subsidiary, affiliate, successor in interest, or agent of
    the User or of EYGS) shall be subject to the dispute resolution
    procedures set forth in section (a) and (b) below. Judgment on any
    arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper
    jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim limited
    solely to injunctive or other equitable relief may be submitted as a
    matter of right by the party seeking such relief to any court having
    proper jurisdiction over such claim.

> \(a) **Mediation**

A party shall submit a dispute to mediation by written notice to the
other party or parties. The mediator shall be selected by the parties.
If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, the International Institute
for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (the "CPR Institute") shall
designate a mediator at the request of a party. Any mediator must be
acceptable to all parties and must confirm in writing that he or she is
not, and will not become during the term of the mediation, an employee,
partner, executive officer, director or substantial equity owner of any
EY Firm's audit client.

The mediator shall conduct the mediation as he/she determines, with the
agreement of the parties. The parties shall discuss their differences in
good faith and attempt, with the mediator's assistance, to reach an
amicable resolution of the dispute. The mediation shall be treated as a
settlement discussion and shall therefore be confidential. The mediator
may not testify for either party in any later proceeding relating to the
dispute. The mediation proceedings shall not be recorded or transcribed.

Each party shall bear its own costs in the mediation. The parties shall
share equally the fees and expenses of the mediator.

If the parties have not resolved a dispute within 90 days after written
notice beginning mediation (or a longer period, if the parties agree to
extend the mediation), the mediation shall terminate and the dispute
shall be settled by arbitration. In addition, if a party initiates
litigation, arbitration, or other binding dispute resolution process
without initiating mediation or before the mediation process has
terminated, an opposing party may deem the mediation requirement to have
been waived and may proceed with arbitration.

\(b) Arbitration

The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in
this document and the CPR Institute Rules for Non-Administered
Arbitration ("Rules") as in effect on the date of the Agreement, or such
other rules and procedures as the parties may agree. In the event of a
conflict, the provisions of this document will control.

The arbitration will be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators,
to be selected in accordance with the screened selection process
provided in the Rules. Any issue concerning the extent to which any
dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability,
interpretation, or enforceability of any of these procedures, shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and resolved by the arbitrators.
No potential arbitrator may be appointed unless he or she has agreed in
writing to these procedures and has confirmed in writing that he or she
is not, and will not become during the term of the arbitration, an
employee, partner, executive officer, director or substantial equity
owner of any EY Firm's audit client.

The arbitration panel shall have no power to award non-monetary or
equitable relief of any sort or to make an award or impose a remedy that
(i) is inconsistent with the agreement to which these procedures are
attached or any other agreement relevant to the dispute, or (ii) could
not be made or imposed by a court deciding the matter in the same
jurisdiction.

Discovery shall be permitted in connection with the arbitration only to
the extent, if any, expressly authorized by the arbitration panel upon a
showing of substantial need by the party seeking discovery.

All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential. The
parties and the arbitration panel may disclose the existence, content or
results of the arbitration only in accordance with the Rules or
applicable professional standards. Before making any such disclosure, a
party shall give written notice to all other parties and shall afford
them a reasonable opportunity to protect their interests, except to the
extent such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law,
regulatory requirements or professional standards.

The result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties, and
judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.
