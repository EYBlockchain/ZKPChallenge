### Break the ZKP Protocol Grand Challenge

# What are the ZKP Protocols and what do they help accomplish?

Blockchains will do for networks of enterprises and business ecosystems what enterprise resource planning (ERP) did for the single company. We believe that the current model of siloed and parallel private networks is unsustainable as large companies seek to build overlapping, parallel networks. Rather, a future of large, regional or sector-specific public Ethereum networks is a more realistic future. To enable this future, in a public environment requires alternative ways to bring trust as full transparency is not acceptable for real business operations. It is not yet possible for companies to conduct secure, private transactions across the public Ethereum network.

In this work here, we use an approach that provides a solution using Zero Knowledge Proofs. Any asset that needs to be tracked is tokenised into a non-fungible token while any payment that needs to be made against this asset is tokenised into a fungible token. Processes are built over the movement of these tokens using business logic executed through smart contracts. But to maintain privacy for business operations regarding what asset has been transferred between which two parties and how much was paid for it, we use 7 different ZKP protocols.

They are:
* Fungible Token Mint : Creates a fungible token on the blockchain that holds value equivalent to the amount deposited. The amount deposited can be in the form of any ERC20 token such as Ether. In this example, we use Dollar Tokens created using `OpsCoin.sol`. Anonymous Parties :
* Fungible Token Transfer : Any fungible token that is minted, can be transferred between
* Fungible Token Burn
* Non-Fungible Token Mint
* Non-Fungible Token Transfer
* Non-Fungible Token Join
* Non-Fungible Token Split

These protocols are used in the movement of any assets and payments on a public blockchain, Ethereum is used here, to ensure privacy.
